9 products appear on the main page, pagination at the bottom of the page if there are more products. 
Anyone can see the products and comments, logged in users can comment on the products and the company. 
Comments become visible when admin approves them. Admin only sees disapproved comments and has no option to comment. 
Admin can add new products.

I used singular pattern for connection.
